## BIG O

It is notation  to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm or method  that use to achieve to goal of  and it the worst case analysis function it based on:

Running Time (time efficiency/complexity)

And it’s known as time efficiency or time complexity which means the amount of time that the method/function or the code took to complete.

Memory Space 
And it’s known as space efficiency or time complexity which means the amount of memory  that the method/function used and stor data on it.

The big omga :the  best case of algorithm efficiency analysis .

Big Theta: the Average Case represents the tight bound of Time and Space.

n:  is refer to the input size

Big o to for  o(n)

Big O to for in for O(n^2)

What is a Linked List?

A Linked List is a series of connected  Nodes to each other and there are two type of it Singly and Doubly.

Each node  consist from value and pointer .




The head point to the first node in the liked list and each node point to the next node  and the final node point to to null

If we went to add a node in the fist

 we must transfer the head from the first node to the new node and make the pointer of new node point to the old-first node

and the pointer of  old- first node point to the next node.
