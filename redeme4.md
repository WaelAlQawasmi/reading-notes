## Variables in java: 
there are fore type of variables in java:
-Instance Variables : Variables stored without the static keyword It has different values in different parts of the class
Class Variables (Static Fields) A  variable that is declared with the static modifier, means the value will not change  .

Local Variables :   the variable that store as temporary variables ,this variable could  declared between braces of a method
Parameters: variables that passed info to  the methods these variables be inside the method  for ex => mathode(Parameter1, Parameter2).

Naming of Variables :
-  the names  of the variables are case-sensitive(upper/lower) cases uou can start on $ or _ but is not good practice.
- When choosing the names of the variables, choose a name that expresses the variable and write it completely without abbreviation, and if it consists of two words, use the camelCase .

## operators : 
 Operators are special characters that do specific operations and then return a result.

## Statements :
the line in code that mostly end in ; and it similar in natural languages to sentences and we can convert the expiration to statement by adding ; to it;
Int a;
