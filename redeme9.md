## Interface 

 An interface in Java is similar to a class and its collection of abstract methods and could have methods  (default/ static and)  and nested types but the body of this method should exist only default or static methods and all of the interfaceâ€™s methods must be defined in the class.
Interface construction is like a class.  But interface contains class implements behaviors.





### Declarant Interfaces:
 > EX1

public interface interfaceName {


   // method signatures, constant declarations if any
   
   // An enum with values RIGHT, LEFT
   int turn(Direction direction,
            double radius,
            double startSpeed,
            double endSpeed);
   int changeLanes(Direction direction,
                   double startSpeed,
                   double endSpeed);
   int signalTurn(Direction direction,
                  boolean signalOn);
   int getRadarFront(double distanceToCar,
                     double speedOfCar);
   int getRadarRear(double distanceToCar,
                    double speedOfCar);
         ......
   // more method signatures
}

There no braces in method signatures in interface and it end with a semicolon
If you  want to use interface  you must write class implements the interface
 >EX2 

public class OperateBMW760i implements OperateCar {

    // the OperateCar method signatures, with implementation --
    // for example:
    public int signalTurn(Direction direction, boolean signalOn) {
       // code to turn BMW's LEFT turn indicator lights on
       // code to turn BMW's LEFT turn indicator lights off
       // code to turn BMW's RIGHT turn indicator lights on
       // code to turn BMW's RIGHT turn indicator lights off
    }

    // other members, as needed -- for example, helper classes not 
    // visible to clients of the interface
}


## Inheritance


>[A]Definitions: A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).

>EX3
>public class Bicycle {
        
   > // the Bicycle class has three fields
   > public int cadence;
   > public int gear;
   > public int speed;
        
   > // the Bicycle class has one constructor
   > public Bicycle(int startCadence, int >startSpeed, int startGear) {
  >      gear = startGear;
  >      cadence = startCadence;
  >      speed = startSpeed;
  >  }
        
    // the Bicycle class has four methods
    public void setCadence(int newValue) {
        cadence = newValue;
    }
        
    public void setGear(int newValue) {
        gear = newValue;
    }
        
    public void applyBrake(int decrement) {
        speed -= decrement;
    }
        
    public void speedUp(int increment) {
        speed += increment;
    }
        
}

 >EX4
public class MountainBike extends Bicycle {
        
    // the MountainBike subclass adds one field
    public int seatHeight;

    // the MountainBike subclass has one constructor
    public MountainBike(int startHeight,
                        int startCadence,
                        int startSpeed,
                        int startGear) {
        super(startCadence, startSpeed, startGear);
        seatHeight = startHeight;
    }   
        
    // the MountainBike subclass adds one method
    public void setHeight(int newValue) {
        seatHeight = newValue;
    }   
}
