# Graphs

## what is the Graphs?
 Graphs is type of non-linear 
  data structure that contain from vertices (nodes) and edges, where the edges  line segments to  connect any two vertices in the graph.
  so based on prives  the 
 neighbors of a vertice  its adjacent nodes
 and the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

 ## Directed and  Undirected Graphs

-  Directed:  called a Digraph it is the   graph that have in every edge  directtion.

-  Undirected: the graph that dosen't hav direction

## Complete , Connected  and Disconnected

- Complete: where all node connected togother

- Connected: graph that it's node at least connect to other node

- Disconnected : graph that some  node at not connected with other node

## Acyclic and Cyclic

- Acyclic :  the graph was directed  without cycles
also called a __DAG__

- Cyclic Graphs:graphes that have cycles.

## Graph Representation

- Adjacency Matrix:
where  we represent graph by a 2d array
 ic case the graph hasn vertices, then we are build   n x n Boolean matrix

- Adjacency List:  linked lists collection or useing array cintine all conected node, and becouse it the esiest way it
 is the most common way to represent graphs.

 ## where we use Graphs in Real World ?


- GPS and Mapping
- Driving Directions
- Social Networks
- Airline Traffic
- Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
